# lmc
A Little Man Computer (http://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC) emulator written in Rust
(and a bit of Python).


## Instructions to operate:
  - Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/1derless/lmc.git`.
  - Assemble your at http://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC, making sure to have the
    "Show Decimal" option enabled.  This is *not* an assembler.
  - Pipe that into `stripper.py`.
  - Save that output into `result.txt`.
